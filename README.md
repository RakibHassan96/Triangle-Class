# Triangle Class

Implement a Triangle class in C++. The triangle is defined by its three side lengths – a, b, and c; by the side length of the two equal sides – a – and the angle (in degrees) between them if isosceles; or by the side length – a – if equilateral. The class includes appropriate class constructors and public and private methods that perform the following operations:

a. Triangle(int a , int b, int c) – Constructor;
b. Triangle(int a , int angle) – Constructor;
c. Triangle(int a) – Constructor;
d. isTriangle – Checks whether the given side lengths form a proper triangle;
e. area – Returns the area of the triangle;
f. perimeter – Returns the perimeter of the triangle;
g. setSides – Mutator function resets the side lengths of the triangle;
h. getAngles – Accessor function returns the angles (in degrees) of the triangle;
i. getSides – Accessor function returns the side lengths of the triangle;
j. print - Returns a string representation of a triangle object: side lengths, vertex
angles, perimeter, and area.
